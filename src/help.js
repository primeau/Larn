    `Welcome to the game of ${GAMENAME}. At this moment, you face a great problem.\n\
Your daughter has contracted a strange disease, and none of your home remedies\n\

try to save her. Time ago you heard of a land of great danger and opportunity.\n\
Perhaps here is the solution you need.\n\

    It has been said that there once was a great magician who called himself\n\
Polinneaus. Many years ago, after having many miraculous successes, Polinneaus\n\
retired to the caverns of ${GAMENAME}, where he devoted most of his time to the\n\
creation of magic. Rumors have it that one day Polinneaus set out to dispel\n\
an attacking army in a forest some distance to the north. It is believed that\n\
here he met his demise.\n\
\n\
    The caverns of ${GAMENAME}, it is thought, must be magnificent in design,\n\

journey into these caverns.\n\

\n\
<b>From:</b> Count Endelford ${lt}endelford@larn.org${gt}\n\
<b>Subject:</b> Thinking of you\n\
\n\
I have devised a trial for you, worm. Your reputation precedes you though \n\
I find it laughable.\n\
\n\
The rules for this challenge are as follows:\n\
o The contest resets as Sunday falls (23:59 UTC).\n\
o You may play only once. Should you attempt a second journey, expect no mercy.\n\
o Saving progress is forbidden. Only the weak seek refuge in such cowardice.\n\
o Wizard mode is strictly and severely forbidden. Invoke it, and my wrath will\n\
  be swift and absolute.\n\
\n\
I present this challenge because I despise you and the opportunity to watch\n\
you fail weekly delights me. I eagerly await your inevitable demise.\n\
\n\
With deepest contempt,\n\
Endelford\n\

\n\
To drop gold, press '<b>.</b>' after pressing '<b>d</b>'. When dropping gold, if you\n\
type '<b>*</b>' as your amount, all your gold is dropped.\n\
\n\
In general, typing in '<b>*</b>' means all of what you're interested in. This is true\n\
when visiting the bank, or when contributing at altars.\n\
\n\
When in the store, trading post, school, or home, an <b>escape</b> will get you out.\n\
\n\
When casting a spell, if you need a list of spells you can cast, type <b>space</b> \n\
at any time and the available list of spells will be shown.\n\
\n\
When an inventory list is on the screen from a drop, quaff, read, or similar\n\
command, you can type the letter of the object that you wish to act apon,\n\
without having to type a space to get back to the prompt.\n\
\n\
If NumLock is off, the Keypad functions in the obvious way for movement. Hold\n\
Shift when pressing any direction on the Keypad to run in that direction. The\n\
5 key on the Keypad is the same as 'stay here', which really means skip your\n\
turn.\n\

`                  <b>Explanation of the ${GAMENAME} scoreboard facility </b> \n\
\n\
${GAMENAME} supports TWO scoreboards, one for winners, and one for deceased\n\
characters. Each player (by the name entered when you start the game)\n\
is allowed one slot on each scoreboard. This design helps ensure that \n\
frequent players of ${GAMENAME} do not hog the scoreboard, and gives more\n\
players a chance for glory. Level of difficulty is also noted on the\n\
scoreboards, and this takes precedence over score for determining what\n\
entry is on the scoreboard. For example: if 'Yar, the Bug Slayer' has\n\
a score of 128003 on the scoreboard at diff 0, then a game at diff 1\n\
and a score of 4112 would replace the previous entry on the scoreboard.\n\
Note that when a player dies, the inventory is stored in the scoreboard\n\
so that everyone can see what items the player had at the time of death.\n\
